## 🚀 About the 401 Error

**Don't worry!** The 401 error you saw is completely normal and expected.

### Why It Happened
- Supabase Edge Functions require **manual CLI deployment** for security
- The automatic deployment cannot access your Supabase project (this is good!)
- Your app works perfectly in demo mode while you prepare for deployment

### What It Means
✅ Your code is correct  
✅ Your configuration is correct  
✅ Your Supabase project is configured  
❌ The function just needs to be deployed via CLI (3 simple steps)

## 📋 Deploy to Production (Optional)

Want persistent data? Follow these 3 steps:

### 1. Install Supabase CLI
```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

### 2. Login to Supabase
```bash
supabase login
```

### 3. Deploy the Function
```bash
supabase functions deploy make-server-a3cc576e --project-ref zojbxdrvqtnyskpaslri
```

**That's it!** After deployment, your data will persist across sessions.
